# CST1500-FinalCoursework
The aim of  the project is to design a calculator using Python.
This project is based on creating a fully functional GUI calculator using Python libraries. The calculator allows a user to carry out both basic and scientific calculations.
Basic calculations include the following mathematic expressions:
1)	Addition and Subtraction
2)	Multiplication and Division
3)	Equal and Clear
Besides, the scientific calculations that can be carried out are:
1)	Square Root
2)	Logarithms 
3)	Make use of pi (π)
4)	Power
5)	Modulus (abs)

Python 
Python is a high-level programming language that can be used for the following applications:
1)	Web Development: Django, Pyramid, Bottle, Tornado, Flask, web2py
2)	GUI Development: tkinter, PyGObject, PyQt, PySide, Kivy, wxPython
3)	Scientific and Numeric: SciPy, Pandas, IPython
4)	Software Development: Buildbot, Trac, Roundup

For this coursework, tkinter was used for the GUI development.
Tkinter 
Tkinter is not the only GUIProgramming toolkit for python as mentioned above, but it is the most commonly used one. It provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.


Math Library
Math library in python allows us to perform a more complex calculation in python.

Implementation
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects rather than functions or logic. 
Since students had to work in pairs (collaborative programming), OOP allows each student to implement a part of the application to achieve the desired result.
 OOP allows:
1. Switch frames by destroying the old one
2. Set the window title
3. Switch between the standard and scientific calculator.


Tkinter
1)	Basic Widgets
•	Frame 
It is a rectangular region used to group related widgets or provide padding between widgets. 
•	Button
It contains text and acts when clicked. 

•	Entry 
It allows a single line of text.

•	Label
It is used to display text on the screen. 

2)	Geometry Manager
o	Pack: It packs the widget on top of the other.


o	Grid: It splits either a window or frame into rows and columns.
		
o	Place: It places the widget at specific positions designed by the programmer.

Functions
Functions were used to carry out specific actions when the buttons are clicked.


Lists
List was used to storing several items in a single variable. It helps to reduce the use of several variables. 

For Loop
For loop was used to loop through the lists to extract its contents.  

Error Handling
This will prevent the program from crashing unexpectedly. 


How can it be improved?
1)	Allow moving through the expression to make any changes.
2)	Enable the user to clear the last item appended to the expression.
